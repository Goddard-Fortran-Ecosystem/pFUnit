3.2.7   May 24, 2016
	- Fix 3.2.7 broke the NAG 6.0 compiler (internal compiler error).
	  Workaround is to simply not use -C=all during the build for now.
	
3.2.6   May 24, 2016
	- Bug fix for several issues identified by the latest NAG compiler
	(6.1).  These are mostly related to nostandard usage of TARGET
	attributes that are unsafe for copyin/copyout.  Many thanks to NAG
	for helping to identify the problems.  Note: these bugs are
	innocuous under most circumstances/compilers.
	
3.2.5   April 27, 2016
	- Another bug that prevented the compiler version workaround from
          being handled correctly.
	
3.2.4   April 27, 2016
	- Bug fix - earlier merge broke unix test for Intel compiler
          version.  This prevented fix in 3.2.2 from being used.
	
3.2.3   April 25, 2016
	- Fixed mistake in OpenMP introduced during previous bug fix.
	
3.2.2   April 24, 2016
	- Workaround for ifort 16.0.2 bug with openmp
	- Various minor improvements to code:
          . Fixed inconsistent names in self tests.
          . Introduced "-qopenmp" in find_package for OpenMP
          . RemoteProxy now ignores output starting with "DEBUG:" - useful
            for debugging self tests.

	
3.2.1	April 21, 2016
	- Trivial bug fix in include/driver.F90.   Missed in rush to do release 3.2.1.
	
3.2.0	April 21, 2016
	- Extension: support test to run on "all available" pes.
	  . This is primarily aimed to enable testing coarray Fortran procedures
	    CAF does not yet have "teams", so tests must use all images.  But
	    MPI users may find it useful as well.   Just use "*" instead of a number
	    when specifying NPES.   True CAF support should be expected in release 4.0.0.
	- Extension: support test case with custom constructor.   With this extension was
	  able to create external extensions to the framework that allow testing ESMF grideded
          components.  Contact Tom Clune if you want to have those extensions - did not want to
	  induce an ESMF requirement for pFUnit.
	- Improved support for CMake (contributed by Pal Levold)
	  . packaging
	  . add_pfunit_test() macro
	  . Ctests (CMake testing package)
	  . NOTE: now requires a more recent CMake version.
	- Increased max filename length to avoid truncation
	- Disabled --verbose command line option (breaks under gcc)
	- Cleanup to reduce/eliminate compiler warnings when building.
	- There is a regression in NAG 6.1, so NAG users should continue to use 6.0 until a
	  fix or a workaround are found
	
3.1.1
	- PGI 15.7 appears to be working robustly
	  . some previously necessary workarounds have been removed
	- Additional documentation for XML printer
	- Improved compliance with JUnit for XML printer
	- Bug fix for RemoteProxyTestCase
	- CMake workaround for OpenMPI 1.8.8 which otherwise complains about nested
	  MPI programs in self tests.
	- Fixed KEEP_ALL option in AssertEqual for zero-length strings.
	  Because "" == " " in Fortran, AssertEqual(""," ",whitespace=KEEP_ALL),
	  which should throw an exception, failed silently for zero-length arrays.
	- Fixed the make clean bug in Example code.
	- Added time out command line arguments.
	- Added PFUNIT_EXTRA_USAGE in include/driver.F90 for suite-wide fixture use.
	- Cray workarounds on a separate branch (hope for a release in November).

3.1	March 20, 2015
	- PGI 15.1 now supported.
	- Asserts over integer arrays now supported. INT32 and INT64 support added.
	- Consolidated assertAssociated directives to:
	    @assertAssociated
	    @assertNotAssociated
	- Added ifndef option to preprocessor directives.
	- Fixes: Name length checking, unbalanced allocate, python 3 basestring.

3.0.2	December 12, 2014
	- Corrected lack of PRESENT check on some optional arguments.
	- Brought integer array version of assertEqual up to level of other numbers.
	- Directives added:
	    @assertEquivalent(...)
	    @assertEqual(a,b)
	    @assertAssociated(...), @assertUnAssociated(...)
	    @assertAssociatedWith(...), @assertUnAssociatedWith(...)
	- Added code to parse brackets in directive arguments,
	    allowing @assertEquivalent([...],[...]).
	    Needed for directives that must parse arguments to construct other calls.
	- Extended assertTrue and assertFalse to cover arrays of logical.
	- Removed dependency on CPP stringification in the REFLECT macro simplifying build.
	- Improved portability of build, fixing problem with OUTPUT_FLAG, i.e. "-o".
	- Fixed build problem on NAG, cmake/gmake, and OS X.
	- Replaced explicit invocations of python with $(PYTHON), set in GNUmakefile,
	    to aid specification.
	- Removed an extraneous allocate (Patch 5).

3.0.1	September 15, 2014
	- Fixed parser bug that was not recognizing user-provided procedures
 	  annotated with @before/@after for MPI tests.
	- Corrected end-of-run logic in include/driver.F90.
	- Minor corrections & simplifications to build process.
	- Improved compilation time by refactoring automatically generated code.
	- Added compile-time configuration parameter to control maximum rank
	  supported by assertions over arrays, e.g. AssertReal.
	- Added "whitespace=IGNORE_DIFFERENCES" and similar options to AssertEqual.


3.0.0	April 04, 2014
	- Design improvement that unfortunately breaks GFortran prior to
	  4.8.3 and 4.9.0 (main reason for major release)
	- Default driver now produces useful return code in serial (and some MPI)
	- New assertions for floating point:  <, <=, >, >=
	- Various improvements to parser
