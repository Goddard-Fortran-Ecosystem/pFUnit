# ChangeLog

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

 - The `add_pfunit_ctest()` macro could fail under several not-so-rare
   circumstances.  One way is for CMake to fail to build
   `OTHER_SOURCES` before the driver as it cannot correctly analyze
   the indirect Fortran `USE PFUNIT_EXTRA_INITIALIZE` statement.  The
   other is when using paralle builds with multiple test suites using
   Intel and the `-save-temps` flag.  Here the compiler would overwrite the 
   `driver.i90` in the build directory and produce confusing results.
   
   The solution is to use Cmake `configure_file()` to preprocess the driver
   directly on a per-suite basis.   This will allow CMake+FPP to corretly 
   analyze dependencies and avoid reuse of `driver.i90`.

## [4.1.15] - 2020-01-06

### Added

- Enabled use off `add_subdirectory` and build directory directly.
  This improves the ability to build pFUnit when embedded within
  another project instead of building it as a separate project.

### Fixed

- Bug in assert for relatively equal.  Incorrect index for location of of first
  failing element.
- Workaround for WSL issue in driver.


## [4.1.14]	

### Added
- Flag for position independent code.

## [4.1.13]	

There is a ticket opened against Intel Fortran 19.2 which breaks some
fHamcrest functionality.  A failing test has been added to the test
suite.  19.1.3 still has this bug.  (I have not checked if earlier
compilers also had this problem, but quite possibly they do as
fHamcrest is still under development.)
	
## Changed

- Separated tests related to RobustRunner into separate test suite.  This is to
  facilitate CI, as the tests do intermittently fail under CI, though rarely
  in any development environment used by the main developers.

- Corrected so that default flags are with aggressive debugging.  This had been
  the default in the past, but was apparently lost for NAG to workaround a compiler
  bug in an intermediate release.  Also corrected the way the flags are managed
  for Debug vs Release.

## Fixed

- Added workaround for NAG+cmake+OpenMP.  An issue has been filed with kitware
  https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/21280

- Missing PRESENT checks for arguments in TestMethod.  Not sure how
  these were not being caught - probably related to change mentioned
  above about skipping debug flags with NAG Fortran.

- Missing RECURSIVE attribute on function in Every.F90.  Not necessary
  in F2008, but not all compilers have implemented this yet.

## [4.1.12] - 2020-08-21

### Fixed
- Problem with FHamcrest `equal_to` where when the expected value is a numeric
  array and the actual value is any type except a numeric array the test still
  passes, such as: ` @assert_that(1, is(equal_to([2, 3, 4])))` passes.
  
- Problem with FHamcrest tests causing a segment fault when a test fails that
  involves a complex number.
  
### Added
- Tests for FHamcrest `equal_to` functionality.

### Changed
- Changed `CMakeLists.txt` for FHamcrest tests to use the new `pfunit_add_ctest`
  cmake macro.


## [4.1.11] - 2020-08-04

### Fixed
- Added flag that allows GFortran 10.x to compile with argument mismatches
  in MPI layer.  This apparently is only an issue for some MPI flavors, with
  others importing the correct interface variability via ```use mpi```.


## [4.1.10] - 2020-07-29

### Fixed
- Fixed problem under WSL+Gfortran-9 in which -O0 crashed pFUnit self tests.
	
## [4.1.9] - 2020-05-29

### Fixed
- Changed internal cmake dependencies so that "make test" will now build
  tests.   The tests and test executables are intentionally EXCLUDE_FROM_OLL
  which interferes with some canonical ways of driving cmake projects.
  "make tests" will continue to work as before.
  

## [4.1.8] - 2020-05-12

- Compiler workarounds
  - Changes in gFTL maps to allow IBM XLF to compile
  - Workaround for GFortran regression in 10.1 release
- Submodule updates
	
## [4.1.7] - 2020-03-06

### Added
- Allow @before without requiring @after

### Changed
- Fixed support for building shared libraries
- Updated to latest submodules


## [4.1.6] - 2020-03-05

### Fixed
  - Corrected problem with cmake -DSKIP_FHAMCREST
  - Command line arguments not working with MPI


## [4.1.5] - 2019-12-12

### Changed
- Fixed XML
- Updated to latest external dependencies (bugfix in fArgParse)
- Start using new format for ChangeLog.md

## [4.1.4] - 2019-12-19

- Fix bug in exported pFUnit.mk file.    Was not correctly expanding openmp libraries for projects built with Make.
- Improved pFunit driver to avoid name conflicts with user defined initialize()

## [4.1.3] - 2019-12-10

- Fix bug in add_pfunit_ctest() macro involving path
  Only affects using with Intel MPI
	
## [4.1.2] - 2019-12-07

- Fix minor bug related to OpenMP propagation
	
## [4.1.1] - 2019-11-10

- Fix for #122 (allow add_pfunit_test() with abs path)

	
## [4.1.0] - November 08, 2019

- Major correction to README to reflect changes from v3.0
- Expansion of hamcrest capabilities
- Completed TAP listener
- Fixes for self-tests that were failing due to Python-3 support
		
	
## [4.0.1] - September 01, 2019

- various (still incomplete) improvements to the README instructions.
- Added preprocessor support for hamcrest @assert_that
- Corrected issue with absolute paths for add_pfunit_sources()

## [4.0.0] - May 2019

- Major cleanup of source code and CMake logic.
- Single build now builds both serial and mpi support layers
- Introduced initial hamcrest support
- Improved mechanism for cmake building of test suites.
- Simplified overload process for assertions.

## [3.2.7] - May 24, 2016

- Fix 3.2.7 broke the NAG 6.0 compiler (internal compiler error).
  Workaround is to simply not use -C=all during the build for now.
	
## [3.2.6] - May 24, 2016

- Bug fix for several issues identified by the latest NAG compiler
  (6.1).  These are mostly related to nostandard usage of TARGET
  attributes that are unsafe for copyin/copyout.  Many thanks to NAG
  for helping to identify the problems.  Note: these bugs are
  innocuous under most circumstances/compilers.
	
## [3.2.5] - April 27, 2016

- Another bug that prevented the compiler version workaround from
          being handled correctly.
	
## [3.2.4] - April 27, 2016

- Bug fix - earlier merge broke unix test for Intel compiler
          version.  This prevented fix in 3.2.2 from being used.
	
## [3.2.3] - April 25, 2016

- Fixed mistake in OpenMP introduced during previous bug fix.
	
## [3.2.2] - April 24, 2016

- Workaround for ifort 16.0.2 bug with openmp
- Various minor improvements to code:
  - Fixed inconsistent names in self tests.
  - Introduced "-qopenmp" in find_package for OpenMP
  - RemoteProxy now ignores output starting with "DEBUG:" - useful
   for debugging self tests.

	
## [3.2.1] - April 21, 2016

- Trivial bug fix in include/driver.F90.   Missed in rush to do release 3.2.1.
	
## [3.2.0] - April 21, 2016

- Extension: support test to run on "all available" pes.
  - This is primarily aimed to enable testing coarray Fortran procedures
    CAF does not yet have "teams", so tests must use all images.  But
    MPI users may find it useful as well.   Just use "*" instead of a number
    when specifying NPES.   True CAF support should be expected in release 4.0.0.
- Extension: support test case with custom constructor.   With this extension was
  able to create external extensions to the framework that allow testing ESMF grideded
  components.  Contact Tom Clune if you want to have those extensions - did not want to
  induce an ESMF requirement for pFUnit.
- Improved support for CMake (contributed by Pal Levold)
  - packaging
  - add_pfunit_test() macro
  - Ctests (CMake testing package)
  - NOTE: now requires a more recent CMake version.
- Increased max filename length to avoid truncation
- Disabled --verbose command line option (breaks under gcc)
- Cleanup to reduce/eliminate compiler warnings when building.
- There is a regression in NAG 6.1, so NAG users should continue to use 6.0 until a
  fix or a workaround are found
	
## [3.1.1]

- PGI 15.7 appears to be working robustly
  - some previously necessary workarounds have been removed
- Additional documentation for XML printer
- Improved compliance with JUnit for XML printer
- Bug fix for RemoteProxyTestCase
- CMake workaround for OpenMPI 1.8.8 which otherwise complains about nested
  MPI programs in self tests.
- Fixed KEEP_ALL option in AssertEqual for zero-length strings.
  Because "" == " " in Fortran, AssertEqual(""," ",whitespace=KEEP_ALL),
  which should throw an exception, failed silently for zero-length arrays.
- Fixed the make clean bug in Example code.
- Added time out command line arguments.
- Added PFUNIT_EXTRA_USAGE in include/driver.F90 for suite-wide fixture use.
- Cray workarounds on a separate branch (hope for a release in November).

## [3.1] - March 20, 2015

- PGI 15.1 now supported.
- Asserts over integer arrays now supported. INT32 and INT64 support added.
- Consolidated assertAssociated directives to:
    ```
    @assertAssociated
    @assertNotAssociated```
- Added ifndef option to preprocessor directives.
- Fixes: Name length checking, unbalanced allocate, python 3 basestring.

## [3.0.2] - December 12, 2014

- Corrected lack of PRESENT check on some optional arguments.
- Brought integer array version of assertEqual up to level of other numbers.
- Directives added:
  ```
	    @assertEquivalent(...)
	    @assertEqual(a,b)
	    @assertAssociated(...), @assertUnAssociated(...)
	    @assertAssociatedWith(...), @assertUnAssociatedWith(...)
   ```
- Added code to parse brackets in directive arguments,
    allowing @assertEquivalent([...],[...]).
    Needed for directives that must parse arguments to construct other calls.
- Extended assertTrue and assertFalse to cover arrays of logical.
- Removed dependency on CPP stringification in the REFLECT macro simplifying build.
- Improved portability of build, fixing problem with OUTPUT_FLAG, i.e. "-o".
- Fixed build problem on NAG, cmake/gmake, and OS X.
- Replaced explicit invocations of python with $(PYTHON), set in GNUmakefile,
    to aid specification.
- Removed an extraneous allocate (Patch 5).

## [3.0.1] - September 15, 2014

- Fixed parser bug that was not recognizing user-provided procedures
	  annotated with @before/@after for MPI tests.
- Corrected end-of-run logic in include/driver.F90.
- Minor corrections & simplifications to build process.
- Improved compilation time by refactoring automatically generated code.
- Added compile-time configuration parameter to control maximum rank
  supported by assertions over arrays, e.g. AssertReal.
- Added "whitespace=IGNORE_DIFFERENCES" and similar options to AssertEqual.

## [3.0.0] - April 04, 2014

- Design improvement that unfortunately breaks GFortran prior to
  4.8.3 and 4.9.0 (main reason for major release)
- Default driver now produces useful return code in serial (and some MPI)
- New assertions for floating point:  <, <=, >, >=
- Various improvements to parser
