\page page_ObtainingPFUNIT Obtaining pFUnit

The best way to obtain pFUnit is to <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/p/pfunit/code/ci/master/tree/">clone
pFUnit from the git repository</a> from SourceForge as follows.

\code
# Read Only Access
git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/pfunit/code pFUnit\endcode

This will create the directory pFUnit in the current working
directory.  

You may also visit the project page at SourceForge and
download the source tarfile "pFUnit.tar.gz" there.

http://sourceforge.net/projects/pfunit/
or
http://sourceforge.net/projects/pfunit/files/latest/download

Extracting this tarfile via a command like

`$ tar zxf ./pFUnit.tar.gz`

will place the pFUnit files into the current working directory.

\section sec_Prerequisites Prerequisites

The development work for pFUnit has mostly been carried out on a
mixture of systems, including high-end computers, Apple Mac OSX, and
linux-based systems.  A preliminary Windows/CYGWIN port has been
contributed by a user. Full use of the system depends on the following
being available.

- Fortran 2003+ (Tested with Intel 14+, NAG 6.0, GCC 4.9.+, IBM's XLF, PGI 15.4)
- The Message Passing Interface (MPI)
- OpenMP
- GNU Make
- Python

Note: Recent changes have exposed a latent bug in GCC 4.8.2.  The fix
is available in the GCC 4.9 development branch and will also appear in
GCC 4.8.3 when that is released.  Users that require older versions of
GCC should use pFUnit 2.1.x.

<a href="http://www.doxygen.org">Doxygen</a> is used to generate documentation.

The system routinely undergoes regression testing with GNU, Intel, and NAG fortran
compilers and OpenMPI.

\section sec_ObtainingPFUNIT Obtaining pFUnit

The best way to obtain pFUnit is to <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/p/pfunit/code/ci/master/tree/">clone
pFUnit from the git repository</a> from SourceForge as follows.

\code
# Read Only Access
git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/pfunit/code pFUnit\endcode

This will create the directory pFUnit in the current working
directory.  

You may also visit the project page at SourceForge and
download the source tarfile "pFUnit.tar.gz" there.

http://sourceforge.net/projects/pfunit/
or
http://sourceforge.net/projects/pfunit/files/latest/download

Extracting this tarfile via a command like

will place the pFUnit files into the current working directory.

For other ways to acquire the code visit

https://sourceforge.net/p/pfunit/code/ci/master/tree/

or contact the pFUnit team.

\section sec_Manifest Manifest - What's in the directory?

In the top level of the pFUnit distribution you will see the following
files.

CMakeLists.txt - Initial support for cmake-based builds.

COPYRIGHT - Contains information pertaining to the use and
distribution of pFUnit.

Examples - Contains examples of how to use pFUnit once it is
installed.

GNUmakefile - The top level makefile for building and installing
pFUnit.

LICENSE - The NASA Open Source Agreement for GSC-15,137-1 F-UNIT, also
known as pFUnit.

README-INSTALL - Basic documentation on pFUnit installation and use.

bin - Executables used to construct and perform unit tests.

include - Files to be included into makefiles or source, including use
code.

source - Source code and scripts of the pFUnit library and framework.

tests - Source code for unit testing pFUnit itself.

tools - Tools used to help develop, build, and install pFUnit.

VERSION - Contains a string describing the current version of the framework.

\section sec_Configuration Configuration
Little needs to be done to configure pFUnit for the build, however
there are several environment variables on which the package depends.

`F90_VENDOR` - is set to include the correct makefile in $(TOP_DIR)/include,
i.e. GNU, Intel, NAG, or PGI.  Case insensitive file systems may cause
some confusion from time-to-time.

`F90` - is set to the Fortran compiler being used: e.g. ifort for Intel,
gfortran for GNU.

`COMPILER` - is set according to `F90_VENDOR` and is automatically set in
the top level makefile.

For MPI-based unit testing, your setup may require the following as well.

`MPIF90`\code
$ export MPIF90=mpif90\endcode

As a convenience for working with multiple MPI configurations, you may
also set the following.

`MPIRUN`\code
$ export MPIRUN=/some.path/mpirun\endcode

PFUNIT_MAX_ARRAY_RANK

`PFUNIT_MAX_ARRAY_RANK` - controls the maximum size of the arrays asserts are
defined over.  If PFUNIT_MAX_ARRAY_RANK is not set, the default is 5 and pFUnit's assertions will be able to handle arrays up to rank 5, i.e. A(:,:,:,:,:).  PFUNIT_MAX_ARRAY_RANK and MAX_RANK do not refer to MPI ranks (process id within a group). Example:\code
$ export PFUNIT_MAX_ARRAY_RANK=5\endcode

`PFUNIT_MAX_RANK` is a deprecated way to set maximum rank and is to be removed in version 4.


`DOXYGEN` - To generate documentation, set DOXYGEN to the desired
executable.  NOTE: Doxygen Version 1.8.5 does not respect CamelCase
names from Fortran source code by currently converting all to
lowercase.  It does this to get HTML links correct for references in
the source code that also do not respect the CamelCase convention.
The Fortran standard specifies case insensitivity.  Doxygen 1.7.x
seems to better respect CamelCase.
\code
$ export DOXYGEN=/opt/local/share/doxygen/doxygen-1.7.6/bin/doxygen\endcode

\section sec_Building Building pFUnit
\subsection sec_BuildingPFUNITSerial Building pFUnit for testing serial codes (Non-MPI)

1. Change to the directory into which pFUnit has been placed.
2. Set the environment variables (for example in bash):
\code
$ export F90=gfortran-mp-4.8
$ export F90_VENDOR=GNU\endcode
3. To build pFUnit for unit testing of serial codes, execute make.
The unit tests for pFUnit itself will run automatically.
\code
$ make tests\endcode
3.1 Occasionally on the first run through, one will get a spurious
(runtime) error, for example in the unix process component.
\code
Re-execute "make tests" to check again.\endcode
4. At this point the pFUnit object library is in the source directory,
along with a large number of Fortran module files.

\subsection sec_BuildingPFUNITMPI Building pFUnit for testing parallel codes (MPI)

To build pFUnit for unit testing MPI-based codes, be sure that the
environment is properly set up for the MPI implementation you are
using. Depending on your local environment, you may need execute the
build within a batch or other job queing system, e.g. an interactive
batch job under PBS. The steps for building pFUnit start out the same
as for the serial case above, but add MPI=YES to the environment to
switch on MPI support.  The MPI-based unit tests for pFUnit itself
will run automatically.  Again, occasionally a spurious (runtime)
error may appear on the first execution.  

3. Execute make as follows.
\code
$ make tests MPI=YES \endcode

4. At this point an MPI-enabled pFUnit object library is in the source
directory, along with a large number of Fortran module files.

Also, one may get some harmless "no symbols" warnings when the pFUnit library is constructed.

\subsection sec_BuildingPFUNITOPENMP OPENMP

Initial (limited) support for OPENMP has been implemented.  At this
writing, a basic functionality is available.

The process for building pFUnit for testing OPENMP-based codes is
similar to that for other paradigms.

3. To compile for OPENMP support execute make as follows.
\code
$ make tests OPENMP=YES\endcode

4. At this point the OPENMP-enabled pFUnit is ready to be installed.

\subsection sec_BuildingPFUNITCleaning Cleaning

To clean the pFUnit build directory for the space or to rebuild there
are two options.

1. Make clean to remove object files and other intermediate products.
\code
$ make clean\endcode

2. Make distclean to remove libraries and other more final products.
\code
$ make distclean\endcode

3. Some directories support a `make src_clean` to remove intermediate
products in subdirectories.

\subsection sec_BuildingPFUNITDocumentation Documentation

A start at documentation for pFUnit is in the documentation directory.
<a href="http://www.doxygen.org">Doxygen</a> is our primary
documentation tool.  To make the documentation, which will be
generated in the documentation directory, please invoke the following
from the top level of your pFUnit distribution.

\code
$ make documentation\endcode

Or to make a reference manual.

\code
$ make documentation/pFUnit2-ReferenceManual.pdf\endcode

To select a specific version of Doxygen, please set the DOXYGEN
environment variable as in \ref sec_Configuration. You may wish to do
this if your code uses CamelCase names as current versions of Doxygen
(1.8.5) do not respect this convention for Fortran.

\subsection sec_BuildingPFUNITCMAKE CMAKE

Initial support for CMAKE has been implemented.  At this
writing, a basic functionality is available.

3. The process for building pFUnit using cmake is as follows.  In the
top directory of the distribution make a new directory to support the
build, then change to that directory and run cmake (pointing back to
the source) to generate the required makefiles.
\code
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ # e.g. cmake -DMPI=YES -DOPENMP=NO -DINSTALL_PATH=<A path> <path to source>
$ cmake -DMPI=NO ..
$ make tests\endcode

One may also set the environment variable PFUNIT instead of setting
INSTALL_PATH on the cmake command line as given above.

If your MPI installation does not provide mpirun, you may try to set
-DMPI_USE_MPIEXEC=YES to tell CMake to use its FindMPI function to
find out how to execute the tests.

4. If the build is successful, then at this point make install should work.

\section sec_Installation Installation
\subsection sec_InstallationSerial Installation - Serial

To install pFUnit for regular use, set INSTALL_DIR to the location in
which to place pFUnit.  This can be done on the make command line.
For example, after compiling pFUnit for serial use (MPI absent or
MPI=NO), please try.
\code
$ # In the top of the pFUnit build directory.
$ make install INSTALL_DIR=/opt/pfunit/pfunit-serial\endcode

Note: you may need special priveleges to install in some locations,
e.g. via sudo.

To test the installation set PFUNIT to INSTALL_DIR, then change the
working directory to Examples in pFUnit distribution and execute
"make," which will run a number of examples.  These include some
expected (intentional) failures.  
\code
$ # In the top pFUnit build directory...
$ export PFUNIT=/opt/pfunit/pfunit-serial
$ cd Examples
$ make\endcode

\subsection sec_InstallationMPI Installation - MPI

For installing an MPI-enabled pFUnit library, change to the top of the
distribution and execute make with MPI=YES.  You may need to "make
distclean" first.  After compilation and pFUnit passes its self-tests,
then installation proceeds as for the serial case above.
\code
$ make install INSTALL_DIR=/opt/pfunit/pfunit-parallel\endcode

To test, set PFUNIT and go into Examples/MPI_Halo directory.
\code
$ # In the top pFUnit build directory...
$ export PFUNIT=/opt/pfunit/pfunit-parallel
$ # The variable MPIF90 must be set to the appropriate build script.
$ export MPIF90=mpif90
$ cd Examples/MPI_Halo
$ make\endcode

This will compile and run a set of parallel examples that includes
intentional failures.  To run all of the examples try executing
"make MPI=YES" in the Examples directory.

\subsection sec_InstallationOPENMP Installation - OPENMP

At this time the OPENMP version of pFUnit can be installed in the same
way as for the serial or MPI-parallel codes.  OPENMP support, tests,
and examples are limited as of this writing.

\subsection sec_InstallationDefaultDirectory Installation - DEFAULT DIRECTORY

If INSTALL_DIR is not set, "make install" will attempt to install
pFUnit into the top build directory.  This will create directories
such as lib and mod in the top level of the build directory and will
overwrite the include/base.mk with include/base-install.mk.  If this
is not desired, then "make develop" will put back the original
base.mk, which is the file to be used for development and building
pFUnit.  In general, we recommend installing to a directory that is not also the
build directory.



\page page_Usage Usage

\li \ref sec_UsageConfiguration
\li \ref sec_UsageHelloWorld
\li \ref sec_UsagePreprocessor
\li \ref sec_UsageExecutingTheTest

\section Usage
\subsection sec_UsageConfiguration Usage - Configuration

For regular use, after installation, the same compiler/MPI development
configuration that was used to build pFUnit should be used.  Once the
environment variables and paths associated with the environment are
set, to configure pFUnit, please set the following.

`PFUNIT` - set to the directory into which pFUnit was installed.

`F90_VENDOR` - set to Intel, GNU, NAG, or PGI accordingly.

\subsection sec_UsageHelloWorld Usage - Hello World

For an example of a simple usage of pFUnit, see Examples/Simple/tests.

The simplest way to write a test is to write a preprocessor input file (extension ".pf"), which is a Fortran free format file with preprocessor directives added.  An example from "helloWorld.pf" follows.
\code
! from helloWorld.pf
@test
subroutine testHelloWorld()
   use pfunit_mod
   implicit none
   @assertEqual("Hello World!","Hello World!")
end subroutine testHelloWorld\endcode
One then instructs the preprocessor to construct a suite to execute these tests via the "testSuites.inc" file as follows.
\code
! from testSuites.inc
ADD_TEST_SUITE(helloWorld_suite)\endcode

At this point, one can invoke the preprocessor to generate a Fortran file that when compiled and linked with pFUnit will execute the tests. For more information please see \ref page_fuproc or try out the examples in Example/Simple.

\section sec_UsagePreprocessor Usage - Preprocessor
Please see \ref page_fuproc.

\section sec_UsageExecutingTheTest Compiling and Executing The Test

An example of a GNU make rule for for the final step of compiling a test follows.

\code
# This step presumes "include $(PFUNIT)/include/base.mk" earlier in the makefile.
tests.x: testSuites.inc myTests.pf
         $(F90) -o $@ -I$(PFUNIT)/mod -I$(PFUNIT)/include \
                $(PFUNIT)/include/driver.F90 \
                ./*$(OBJ_EXT) $(LIBS) $(FFLAGS)\endcode

To execute the tests, one invokes "./tests.x" with the appropriate command line options (see below).

In some cases, since include/driver.F90 is "implicit none," it may be
necessary to insert a "use" clause to identify external suite-wide
fixture code to the compiler.  As a convenience, the CPP macro
PFUNIT_EXTRA_USAGE can be set to a module of fixture code via a
compiler command line argument turning on a "use PFUNIT_EXTRA_USAGE"
line at the beginning of include/driver.F90.

\subsection ss_UsageExecutingTheTestParallel - Compiling and Executing the Tests (MPI PARALLEL)

One invokes MPI-based parallel tests according to the MPI framework being used.  For example:

\code
$ mpirun -np 4 tests.x\endcode


\subsection ss_CommandLineOptions Command Line Options

The executable test program provides several command line options,
when "include/driver.F90" is used, as it is automatically when using
the PFUNIT preprocessor.

<table border="0" >
<tr><td>-v or -verbose        </td><td>Verbose execution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>-d or -debug  </td><td>Provide debugging information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>-h            </td><td>Print help message.</td></tr>
<tr><td>-o \<outputfile\> </td><td>Direct pFUnit messages to a file.
<tr><td>-robust       </td><td>Use the robust runner. Runs tests as processes so failures do not halt testing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>-max-timeout-duration <duration> Limit detection time for robust runner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>-max-launch-duration  <duration> Limit detection time for robust runner.</td></tr>
<tr><td>-skip \<number of tests to skip\></td><td>Use the subset runner, which runs a subset of the tests in a suite.</td></tr>
<tr><td>-xml \<xmlfile\></td><td>Generate XML output in JUnit
compatible format, write it to given file. This XML output can be used
in integration with e.g. Jenkins. To ensure the XML file is written
correctly, it is recommended to also use the -robust flag.</td></tr>
<tr><td>-name \<name\></td><td>Give the set of tests an identifying
name, which is used in the XML output.</td></tr>
</table>

An example from Examples/Robust:

\code
$ ./tests.x -robust\endcode

\subsection ss_XML XML output

To output JUnit XML, execute tests with the -xml flag:
\code
$ ./tests.x -robust -xml test.xml -name my_suite_name\endcode

This creates a file named test.xml. As an example, the output may look like this:

\code
<testsuite name="my_suite_name" errors="1" failures="1" tests="3" time="2.1020">
<testcase name="test_math_suite.test_addition"/>
<testcase name="test_math_suite.test_division">
<error message="Location: [[unknown location]], RUNTIME-ERROR: terminated during execution "/>
</testcase>
<testcase name="test_other_suite.test_foo">
<failure message="Location: [ test_other.pf:24],  "/>
</testcase>
</testsuite>
\endcode

Output explained: The test suite took 2.1020 seconds to execute. One
test (test_addition) succeeded, one (test_division) crashed for some
reason, and one test (test_foo) failed at line 24 of test_other.pf.

\page page_Development Development

Generally pFUnit development is performed in the build directory
structure.  Care should be taken to make clean or distclean in between
configuration changes.  As stated in \ref sec_Installation, it is best
to set INSTALL_DIR and "make install" pFUnit to another directory that
can be placed in a
user's paths.

\subsection FAQIntel13 Intel Fortran Version 13: -DINTEL_13

Using version 13 is deprecated. We have encountered problems using
version 13, which we believe may be due to subtle compiler bugs.  We
strongly recommend upgrading to the latest version possible.

To make pFUnit work with Intel Fortran Version 13, please ensure that
<code>-DINTEL_13</code> is passed to the compiler when building or
using pFUnit. In the build process for pFUnit, this is added to the
make variables CPPFLAGS and FPPFLAGS.

\subsection FAQSegAndLinkFaults Segmentation Faults and Odd Link Errors

Q. pFUnit fails to build or now leads to segmentation faults.  Did something change?

A. One cause for failure to build or odd runtime segmentation faults is when we change compiler configurations and some object or library files are left over from a previous environment.  This might be hard to spot, for example, during compiler upgrades.  Switching from one compiler to another, e.g. from Intel to GNU, is more likely to generate link-time errors if old code is still around.  A few items to check follow.

<ul>
<li>Execute <em>make distclean</em> or remove objects (or their directories if using CMAKE) associated with previous builds.</li>
<li>Ensure pFUnit and user applications are compiled using compatible (or the same) compilers.</li>
<li>Ensure the environment variable PFUNIT is set to the appropriate install directory.</li>
</ul>

Finally, it is quite possible that a bug has been uncovered.  Please contact the development team or open a <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/pfunit/bugs/?source=navbar">bug ticket</a>.


\section sec_Tips Tips

\subsection TipEnvironmentModules Environment Modules
Though not strictly required, the Environment
Modules package can be a convenient way to package, maintain, and
switch between environments.  This can be particularly important for
pFUnit, which must be built using the same tool suite being used for
development, e.g. compilers, linkers, etc. [To do:  A sample pFUnit
modulefile is provided in the OTHER directory.] 

\subsection TipCompileTimeErrors Compile Time Errors
Compile time errors like '"include [...]include/.mk" not found'
likely signify that you are not executing make in the top level
directory during a build.  Alternatively, during regular usage after
installation, PFUNIT has not been set. 

During building, if you wish to compile in a subdirectory within the
pFUnit heriarchy, please try setting the COMPILER environment variable
on the make command line.  For example:

\code
$ make all COMPILER=Intel\endcode

\subsection TipIntermediateFiles Intermediate files used by pFUnit
If you wish to see the intermediate files, use the target .PRECIOUS
in the makefile to keep them from being deleted. For example:

\code
# In GNUmakefile
.PRECIOUS: %_cpp.F90\endcode 

\subsection TipWhitespace Ignoring whitespace differences in assertions on strings.
Several options exist for how to compare strings with assertEqual.

\code
call assertEqual(expectedString, foundString, &
               & whitespace=IGNORE_DIFFERENCES )\endcode

<strong>WhitespaceOptions:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>IGNORE_DIFFERENCES</strong> ignores whitespace differences (number and value).</li>
<li><strong>IGNORE_ALL</strong> strictly ignores all whitespace (spaces & tabs).</li>
<li><strong>TRIM_ALL</strong> strictly ignores leading and trailing whitespace.  </li>
<li><strong>KEEP_ALL</strong> keeps all whitespace as significant, even discriminating
           between tabs and spaces.</li>
</ul>

Example usages can be seen in tests/Test_AssertBasic.F90 or
Examples/Simple/tests/helloWorld.pf.

generally to be found in an example's "tests" subdirectory.

\subsection ss_Configuration Configuration - testSuites.inc

The include file "testSuites.inc" tells the preprocessor to generate
code for TestSuites listed therein.  The suite names are based on the
TestCases provided in the preprocessor input file or the name of the
preprocessor input file (.pf) itself.  For example, if no module is defined
in a .pf file, i.e. the preprocessor will define the module, one
can set up a "testSuites.inc" as follows.
\code
! To load "exampleTestsNoModule.pf".
ADD_TEST_SUITE(exampleTestsNoModule_suite)\endcode
For a .pf file that contains a module associated with a test suite the
syntax is as follows.
\code
! To load "exampleTests.pf" implementing the module exampleTests_mod.
ADD_TEST_SUITE(exampleTests_mod_suite)\endcode

\subsection ss_Invocation Invocation

To run the preprocessor on on a preprocessor input file "exampleTests.pf", invoke:
\code
$ ${PFUNIT}/bin/fuproc exampleTests.pf exampleTests.F90 \endcode
A convenient GNUmakefile rule is as follows.
\code
%.F90: %.pf
       $(PFUNIT)/bin/fuproc $<  $@ \endcode

\subsection ss_PreprocessorInput Preprocessor Input File (.pf)

The preprocessor input file is a Fortran free format file that
contains subroutines, including those implementing the suite of tests,
or a module with the tests, TestCases, and support for parameters.
The preprocessor reads and parses this file producing a fortran file
implementing the tests, automating some boilerplate code.  Embedded
"@" directives inform the preprocessor about information needed to
generate the test suite.  If the .pf file does not implement a module
providing a test suite, the preprocessor will use the name of .pf file
referred to by "testSuites.inc".  Currently only one test suite per
.pf file is allowed, a limitation of the current implementation of the
parser.

Many example .pf files may be found in the examples'
"tests" subdirectories in the Examples directory.

Below we present the most commonly used directives first, but in a .pf
file using all of these capabilities, the most common order is as
follows.
<ul>
   <li>\ref s3_atParameters</li>
   <li>\ref s3_atTestCase</li>
   <li>\ref s3_atTest or \ref s3_atMPITest
   <ul><li>\ref s3_atAssert</li>
   </ul>
   </li>
</ul>


\subsection ss_Directives Directives

Preprocessor "@" directives, which in keeping with Fortran style are
not case sensitive, instruct the preprocessor how to interpret parts
of the code relevant to the generation of the test suite.  The most
important directives follow.

\subsubsection s3_atTest @Test

This directive is used to indicate a test routine to the preprocessor,
which then includes it in the test suite.  There may be multiple
tests in the .pf file, each annotated by the \@Test directive.  

\@Test also supports MPI-parallel tests (see \ref s3_atMPITest ).

An example, from Examples/Fixture:

\code
@Test
   subroutine testBracketInterior(this)
      class (Test_LinearInterpolator), intent(inout) :: this
      @assertEqual([3,4], this%interpolator%getBracket(at=4.))
   end subroutine testBracketInterior

@Test
   subroutine testInterpolateAtNode(this)
      class (Test_LinearInterpolator), intent(inout) :: this
      @assertEqual(2., this%interpolator%interpolate(at=3.))
   end subroutine testInterpolateAtNode\endcode


\subsubsection s3_atMPITest @MPITest

\ref s3_atMPITest is deprecated as \@Test now handles this case.

This directive indicates an MPI parallel test to the preprocessor,
which then includes it in an MPI enabled test suite.  The directive
takes a single argument, the requested number of MPI processes to run.
The syntax, exemplified by one of the tests from Examples/MPI_Halo:

\code
@Test( npes=[1,2,3])
subroutine testHaloInterior(this)
   use Halo_mod
   use pfunit_mod
   implicit none
   class (MpiTestMethod) :: this

   integer, parameter :: N = 2
   real :: a(N,0:N+1)
   integer :: p

   p = this%getProcessRank()
   a(:,1:N) = p
   a(:,0) = -1
   a(:,N+1) = -1

   call haloFill(a, this%getMpiCommunicator())

   @assertEqual(real(p), a(1,1))
   @assertEqual(real(p), a(2,1))
   @assertEqual(real(p), a(1,2))
   @assertEqual(real(p), a(2,2))

end subroutine testHaloInterior\endcode

\subsubsection s3_atAssert @Assert

The \@Assert directives are expanded into calls to similarly named
pFUnit library routines.  The syntax for the directives follows the
pattern for \@assertEqual below.

\code
@assertEqual(expected,found,'An identifying or explanatory message.')\endcode

The preprocessor will automatically add information about source
location (file & line number) to the call emitted to the test suite
code.  It also adds the check for exceptions.

For more information about \@assert directives, please refer to the following.

<ul>
   <li>\ref ss_assertEqual</li>
   <li>\ref ss_assertTrue</li>
   <li>\ref ss_assertEqualUserDefined</li>
   <li>\ref ss_assertFalse</li>
   <li>\ref ss_assertLessThan</li>
   <li>\ref ss_assertLessThanOrEqual</li>
   <li>\ref ss_assertGreaterThan</li>
   <li>\ref ss_assertGreaterThanOrEqual</li>
   <li>\ref ss_assertIsMemberOf</li>
   <li>\ref ss_assertContains</li>
   <li>\ref ss_assertAny</li>
   <li>\ref ss_assertAll</li>
   <li>\ref ss_assertNotAll</li>
   <li>\ref ss_assertNone</li>
   <li>\ref ss_assertIsPermutationOf</li>
   <li>\ref ss_assertExceptionRaised</li>
   <li>\ref ss_assertSameShape</li>
   <li>\ref ss_assertIsNaN</li>
   <li>\ref ss_assertIsFinite</li>
   <li>\ref ss_assertAssociated</li>
   <li>\ref ss_assertNotAssociated</li>
   <li>\ref ss_assertEquivalent</li>
</ul>


\subsubsection s3_atParameters @Parameters

The \@Parameter directive indicates the declaration of the
parameterized type used to generate the iteration over the multiple
parameter values.  It also identifies the names of the parameters to
be iterated over.  The preprocessor extracts type information from the
declaration of the parameter type collection that immediately follows
the directive. This directive will set up the iteration.  To define
the parameter values per iteration the <code>getParameters</code>
method of the abstract ParameterizedTest must be implemented. For
example:

\code
  @Parameters = [p1,p2]
  type, extends(AbstractTestParameter) :: exampleCase
     integer :: i
     real :: x
  end type exampleCase\endcode

\subsubsection s3_atTestCase @TestCase

This directive identifies to the preprocessor the TestCase
declaration.  The type declared at this point extends TestCase (or its
extension), which includes setting methods such as the following:
setUp, tearDown, runMethod, userMethod.  For the extension
MPITestCase, as with ParameterizedTestCase, you have the option
(requirement if parameters are used) to set getParameters and
getParameterString.  For example:

\code
  @TestCase
  type, extends(MPITestCase) :: Test_Parameters
     integer :: p1, p2
     procedure(runMethod), pointer :: userMethod => null()
   contains
     procedure, nopass :: getParameters
     procedure :: getParameterString => getParameterString_
     procedure :: runMethod
  end type Test_Parameters\endcode

\section sec_AssertPreprocessorDirectives @Assert Preprocessor Directives
\subsection ss_assertEqual @assertEqual
\subsection ss_assertTrue @assertTrue
\subsection ss_assertEqualUserDefined @assertEqualUserDefined
A convenience function that allows a user to write
\code
@assertEqualUserDefined(a,b)\endcode
instead of 
\code
call assertTrue(a==b,...)\endcode
while a more instructive error message about the arguments and
source code position is added by the preprocessor.  The user may
add an error message as follows.
\code
@assertEqualUserDefined(a,b,message='a and b should be equal here.')\endcode

\subsection ss_assertFalse @assertFalse
\subsection ss_assertLessThan @assertLessThan
\subsection ss_assertLessThanOrEqual @assertLessThanOrEqual
\subsection ss_assertGreaterThan @assertGreaterThan
\subsection ss_assertGreaterThanOrEqual @assertGreaterThanOrEqual
\subsection ss_assertIsMemberOf @assertIsMemberOf
\subsection ss_assertContains @assertContains
\subsection ss_assertAny @assertAny
\subsection ss_assertAll @assertAll
\subsection ss_assertNotAll @assertNotAll
\subsection ss_assertNone @assertNone
\subsection ss_assertIsPermutationOf @assertIsPermutationOf
\subsection ss_assertExceptionRaised @assertExceptionRaised
\subsection ss_assertSameShape @assertSameShape
\subsection ss_assertIsNaN @assertIsNaN
\subsection ss_assertIsFinite @assertIsFinite
\subsection ss_assertAssociated @assertAssociated
@assertAssociated maps to a call to the logical intrinsic function associated.
\code
@assertAssociated(a)\endcode
becomes
\code
call assertTrue(associated(a))\endcode

The directive also handles the two-argument pointer-target case.
\code
@assertAssociated(pointer,target)\endcode
becomes
\code
call assertTrue(associated(pointer,target))\endcode
neglecting message and source location information.

A message may be passed as follows.
\code
@assertAssociated(a,message="A message.")\endcode

\code
@assertAssociated(pointer,target,message="A message.")\endcode

\subsection ss_assertNotAssociated @assertNotAssociated

This directive is the same as assertAssociated, except that it maps to assertFalse.  This directive was originally released as assertUnAssociated.

\subsection ss_assertEquivalent @assertEquivalent
This directive compares two logical values and throws an exception annotated with some useful information.
We get a special directive for this one because comparing logicals uses the .eqv. infix operator in standard
Fortran. The arguments a and b below may be 1d arrays.
\code
@assertEquivalent(a,b)\endcode
becomes
\code
call assertTrue(a.eqv.b)\endcode
neglecting the specification of message and source location information.
