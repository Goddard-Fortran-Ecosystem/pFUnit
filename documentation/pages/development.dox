\page page_Development Development

Generally pFUnit development is performed in the build directory
structure.  Care should be taken to make clean or distclean in between
configuration changes.  As stated in \ref sec_Installation, it is best
to set INSTALL_DIR and "make install" pFUnit to another directory that
can be placed in a
user's paths.
