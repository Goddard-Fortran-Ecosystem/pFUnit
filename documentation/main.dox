\section sec_Overview Overview

pFUnit is a unit testing framework enabling JUnit-like testing of
serial and MPI-parallel software written in Fortran.  Initial support
for OPENMP has been implemented.  pFUnit makes use of modern Fortran
programming techniques, including object oriented programming,
offering a convenient, lightweight mechanism for Fortran developers to
create and run software tests that specify the desired behavior for a
given piece of code.  The framework was originally created by
developers from NASA and NGC TASC.  The project is hosted at <a
href="https://github.com/Goddard-Fortran-Ecosystem/pFUnit">Goddard-Fortran-Ecosystem/pFUnit</a>.
